Calculator app from a tutorial by Zell Liew (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/)

I created a calculator as part of the codebar Javascript testing tutorial. I used Jasmine to test the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division formulas.

I built a calculator using HTML + CSS but when I found the tutorial for the Javascipt I used the provided HTML + CSS calculator as a base and redesigned it as my own in CSS. 

I worked on the JavaScript from the tutorial and with the guidance of coaches at Codebar. IT is my first attempt at refactoring a big project and also using git to commit my changes.

Notes on git:
To check the status of my files and what has been modified: git add
To see what changes have been made to the files: git diff (q to exit git diff)
To see what commits have been made: git log (the latest commit is at the top)
To commit changes ("Changes not staged for commit"): git commit -a -m "name of commit"
